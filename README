These are some useful PERL scripts for Ardour sessions.

They work on session version 3001.

They all use library XML-LibXML, which is the
Perl Binding for libxml2, you can download it
from CPAN.

On Fedora you can install the package perl-XML-LibXML.

findtracks.pl lists all the tracks in an Ardour session.

showtrack.pl shows the XML node of a track (Route).

randtracks adds (in the relative way) an amount to the
start of all the regions in the active playlist of a
set of tracks. It's useful if you want to humanize a
drum track made of single shots.

scaleautomation adds (in the relative way) an amount in dB
to tracks which contain automation data. It now works also
on tracks with fixed level.

These scripts act on Ardour session files, so
MAKE BACKUPS before using them.
